    "content": "If your CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) surveys are not appearing, here are common causes and solutions:\n\n1. CSAT Not Enabled:\n   - Go to Settings > CSAT\n   - Ensure the 'Enable CSAT' toggle is turned ON\n   - Check that you've selected the shared mailboxes where CSAT should be active\n\n2. Survey Trigger Conditions Not Met:\n   - CSAT surveys only trigger when an email is marked as 'Closed'\n   - Verify that you're closing emails, not just archiving them\n   - Check if the email thread has multiple back-and-forth exchanges (some settings require minimum interactions)\n\n3. Survey Timing Settings:\n   - Review your CSAT timing configuration\n   - Default is to send surveys immediately after closing, but you may have set a delay\n   - Check if there's a 'quiet hours' setting that prevents surveys during certain times\n\n4. Email Domain Restrictions:\n   - Some organizations restrict CSAT to specific customer domains\n   - Verify that the recipient's email domain is not in your exclusion list\n   - Check Settings > CSAT > Domain Filters\n\n5. Survey Template Issues:\n   - Ensure your CSAT template is properly configured\n   - Check that the survey question and rating scale are set up\n   - Verify that the 'From' email address is valid and not blocked\n\n6. Customer Already Surveyed:\n   - Hiver prevents duplicate surveys for the same conversation\n   - If a customer was already sent a CSAT for this thread, they won't receive another\n   - Check the conversation history for previous survey sends\n\n7. Browser or Email Client Issues:\n   - Clear browser cache and cookies\n   - Try a different browser\n   - Check if the survey email is landing in spam folders\n\n8. Permission Settings:\n   - Verify that your user role has permission to send CSAT surveys\n   - Admin users can check role permissions in Settings > Team > Roles\n\nDebugging Steps:\n1. Check CSAT logs in Settings > CSAT > Survey History\n2. Look for error messages or failed survey attempts\n3. Test with a sample email to yourself\n4. Contact Hiver support with conversation ID if issue persists\n\nNote: CSAT surveys are only available on certain Hiver plans. Verify your plan includes this feature."
